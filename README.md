### CodeSandbox Embedding

CodeSandbox is embedded for users to visualize and interact with the generated code in a live environment.
(_The qualitative measure encounters a challenge as CodeSandbox updated its policy,
affecting pricing options on January 30th, 2024. Consequently, it will no longer be
free to use its embed functionality._)
